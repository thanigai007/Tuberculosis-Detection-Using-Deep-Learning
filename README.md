# Tuberculosis-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning

## 📌 Problem Statement  
Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health issue, particularly in developing countries.  
Manual diagnosis from chest X-rays is often time-consuming and prone to human error.  
The objective of this project is to develop a **deep learning-based system** that can automatically  
detect TB from chest X-ray images, assisting radiologists and improving early diagnosis.

---

## ✅ Solution  
We propose a **transfer learning approach** where pre-trained deep learning models  
are fine-tuned on the TB X-ray dataset. The system is deployed as an **interactive  
Streamlit application**, enabling users to upload X-ray images and receive predictions in real time.

## 🧠 Models Used  
- **ResNet50**  
- **VGG16**  
- **EfficientNetB0**  

After experimentation, the **best performing model** was selected for deployment.

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics  
To measure model performance, we used the following metrics:  
- **Accuracy**  
- **Precision**  
- **Recall**  
- **F1-Score**  
- **ROC-AUC**
